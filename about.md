## Background

I am born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Currently, majoring in computer engineering at Jackson State University. 
I am a member of the W.E.B. Du Bois Honors College and team-lead for JSU's NASA Swarmathon and also participate in a number of professional organizations, including CodeZone, IEEE, Writing Center Peer Tutor, and NSBE. During my freshman year, I interned at The Washington Center (TWC), where I worked for the startup NotInMyCountry. On the following summer, I interned at a local company in Jackson, MS p3strategies as data analyst. In the summer of 2016 as the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates ( DREU ) program, I worked at the University of New Mexico with Dr. Malernie Moses on swarm robotics. 
I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. on Robotics or related fields after graduating form Jackson State University.
