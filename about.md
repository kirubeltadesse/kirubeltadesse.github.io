## Background
Growing up in a country with a rich history and numerous socio-economic problems made me set a goal in my life early on. I dreamt 
of becoming the prime-minister of Ethiopia as I thought problems could only be solved through politics. However, a political science 
professor advised me to consider that politics is not the only way. Aspiring to bring about tangible change in the world by advancing 
our technological capability, I took his advice and pursued Computer Engineering, and realized that science and technological 
advancement can also provide solutions. The moment I started programming, the idea of pouring human sense into a machine in the form 
of algorithms fascinated me. Moreover, the application of machines (robots) is evident in many sectors, from entertainment and 
construction to healthcare and rescue missions, effectively bettering human life. As an undergraduate, I established a foundation in
understanding how computers operate and researched robotics which has led me to pursue a Master's at Purdue University. 

As a Computer Engineering student with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I have combined my 
passions for engineering, design, data mining, optimization,  and security. I would take initiative daily to merge my 
knowledge of agile software development and problem-solving skills to contribute to the development of your state-of-the-art 
products.

Engineering to me is ensuring that a product is meeting the form, function, and quality that the designer intended. As a
Research Assistant at Visualization Lab, my daily goal is to not only build visualizations but also make sure that my code 
and everyone within my team is using an object-oriented programming approach. Being a team leader in the development side, 
I navigate my team through the design process to address technical challenges with the right solutions. Therefore, I have 
a highly effective capability to communicate professionally to a diverse group through listening, lending ideas, and implementing 
the solution.

Having interned in the NASA Swarmathon research, large-scale interdisciplinary research at the University of New Mexico in 
conjunction with NASA, I developed a transform package in C++ using a simple math concept called similar triangle. I also 
compared my result with the Robot Operating System transform package (ROS-TF) in C++. Several of my projects were approved 
for the next Swarmathon challenge. I tested my work with both actual robots and Gazebo simulator which helped me develop agile 
software development skills. 

During my undergraduate program at Jackson State University, I participated in professional origainzation such as 
W.E.B. Du Bois Honors College, IEEE, Writing Center Peer Tutor, NSBE, and I led JSU's NASA Swarmathon and CodeZone teams. 
In addition, I contributed with Dr. Malernie Moses from University of New Mexico on swarm robotics.
