<p>Growing up in a country with a rich history and numerous socio-economic problems made me set a goal in my life early on. 
I dreamt of becoming the prime minister of Ethiopia as I thought problems could only be solved through politics. However, 
a political science professor advised me to consider that politics is not the only way. Aspiring to bring about tangible 
change in the world by advancing our technological capability, I took his advice and pursued Computer Engineering, and 
realized that science and technological advancement could also provide solutions. The moment I started programming, the 
idea of pouring human sense into a machine in the form of algorithms fascinated me. Moreover, the application of machines 
(robots) is evident in many sectors, from entertainment and construction to healthcare and rescue missions, effectively 
bettering human life. As an undergraduate, I established a foundation in understanding how computers operate and researched 
robotics, which has led me to pursue a Master’s at Purdue University.</p>

<p>As a Computer Engineering student with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I have combined my passions for 
engineering, design, data mining, optimization, and security. I would take the initiative daily to merge my knowledge of
agile software development and problem-solving skills to contribute to the development of your state-of-the-art products.
Engineering, to me, is ensuring that a product is meeting the form, function, and quality that the designer intended. As
a Research Assistant at Visualization Lab, my daily goal is to not only build visualizations but also make sure that my 
code and everyone within my team is using an object-oriented programming approach. Being a team leader in the development 
side, I navigate my team through the design process to address technical challenges with the right solutions. Therefore, 
I have a highly effective capability to communicate professionally to a diverse group through listening, lending ideas, 
and implementing the solution.</p>

<p>Having interned in the NASA Swarmathon research, large-scale interdisciplinary research at the University of New Mexico 
in conjunction with NASA, I developed a transform package in C++ using a simple math concept called similar triangle. I 
also compared my result with the Robot Operating System transform package (ROS-TF) in C++. Several of my projects were 
approved for the next Swarmathon challenge. I tested my work with both actual robots and Gazebo simulator, which helped 
me develop agile software development skills.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate program at Jackson State University, I participated in professional organizations such as W.E.B.
Du Bois Honors College, IEEE, Writing Center Peer Tutor, NSBE, and I led JSU’s NASA Swarmathon and CodeZone teams. Also, 
I contributed with Dr. Malernie Moses from the University of New Mexico on swarm robotics.</p>
