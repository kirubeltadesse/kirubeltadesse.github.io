Hello! My name is Kirubel, and I enjoy combining machine learning capabilities with any industry. I love working on open-source projects and collaborating with people on mini-projects that explain fundamental machine-learning concepts and can be used in everyday life.

I work at Bloomberg as a Software Engineer interested in Artificial Intelligence and deep learning model deployment.

I also work on the side with a few friends on a few projects implementing machine-learning models to solve real-world problems. From courses like fast.ai, I have learned how to implement machine learning models to solve real-world problems. I have learned how to deploy machine learning models using AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

Aside from understanding and implementing machine learning models, I work on system design and architecture. I am currently working on an Amharic translation for [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/820).

I am always looking for folks who are interested in aiding on ongoing or newly created projects.

- Contact me by email if you are interested on the project below!

- Some of the Ongoing works:
  - [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course
  - Amharic translation for System Design Primer
  - Machine learning model deployment
  - Anomaly detection
    - Explore and implement traditional theories of Anomaly detection
    - Explore and implement quantitative strategies for Anomaly detection

If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping, don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
