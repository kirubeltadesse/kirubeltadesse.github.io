Hello! My name is Kirubel, and I absolutely love to combine machine learning capabilities with any type of industry. I love to working on open source projects and collaborating with people on mini projects that explains fundamental concepts of machine learning and can be use in your everyday life.

I am currently working at Bloomberg as a Software Engineer with a interest on Artificial Intelligence and deep learning model deployment.

I also do work on the side with a few friends on a few projects implementing machine learning models to solve real world problems. From course like fast.ai, I have learned how to implement machine learning models to solve real world problems. I have also learned how to deploy machine learning models using AWS and Google Cloud Platform.

Aside from understanding and implementing machine learning models, I work on system design and architecture. I am currently working on Amharic translation for [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/820).

I am always looking for folks who are interested in aiding on ongoing or newly created projects.

- Contact me at email if interested!
- Some of the Ongoing works:
  - [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course
  - Amharic translation for System Design Primer
  - Machine learning model deployment
  - Anomaly detection
    - Explore and implement traditional theories of Anomaly detection
    - Explore and implement quantitative strategies of Anomaly detection

If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping out, please contact me!
