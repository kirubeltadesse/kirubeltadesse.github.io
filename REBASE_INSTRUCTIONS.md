# Hugo Migration PR Rebase - Completed

## Summary

This document describes the successful rebase of PR #51 (Hugo Migration) onto the latest master branch.

## Context

PR #51 (`copilot/fix-50` branch) contains the Hugo migration work, which was originally branched from commit `2b4299d`. Since then, master has advanced to commit `90aa652` with 4 additional commits:
- `90aa652` - Bump rexml from 3.3.9 to 3.4.2 (#60)
- `1d20086` - Update urls (#59)
- `3e6268c` - Update the contact page view (#58)
- `d93ef3b` - Remove type error the the screen (#57)

## Rebase Process

The Hugo migration branch was successfully rebased onto master (`90aa652`). The following conflicts were encountered and resolved:

### Conflicts Resolved

1. **Jekyll files deleted by migration, modified in master:**
   - `_config.yml`
   - `Gemfile.lock`
   - `_includes/cal.html`
   - `_includes/header.html`
   - `_includes/scripts/gallery.html`
   - `_layouts/about.html`
   - `_pages/gallery.md`
   - `_pages/index.md`
   
   **Resolution:** Files were properly removed (as intended by the Hugo migration).

2. **Content conflicts:**
   - `content/projects/ai.md`: Conflict between migration version and master version with updated bird detection link
     - **Resolution:** Kept the newer version from master with the complete link: `[bird detection](https://kirubeltadesse.github.io/blog/posts/Is_it_a_bird/Is_it_a_bird.html)`
   
   - `content/news/2024-04-25-huggingface.md`: New file from migration
     - **Resolution:** File was kept (added by migration)

## Result

The rebased commits are now available on branch `hugo-migration-rebased` and locally on `copilot/fix-50`:

```
* 40dd970 Update the about and the personal pages
* 4ca1776 Complete Hugo migration with all content, layouts, and GitHub Actions
* 05a4be7 Initial Hugo site structure created with basic layouts and content
* d0ffa49 Initial assessment - analyzed current Jekyll site structure
* 21a1980 Initial plan
* 90aa652 (origin/master) Bump rexml from 3.3.9 to 3.4.2 (#60)
```

## Hugo Site Verification

After rebase, the Hugo site structure is intact:
- ✅ `hugo.toml` - Hugo configuration file present
- ✅ `content/` - Content directory with proper structure
- ✅ `layouts/` - Layout templates directory
- ✅ `static/` - Static assets directory
- ✅ `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` - Hugo deployment workflow
- ✅ Jekyll files removed (no `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, `_includes/`, `_layouts/`, `_pages/`)

## Next Steps

To update PR #51 with the rebased code:

1. The rebased commits are ready in the local repository
2. A force-push to `copilot/fix-50` is required: `git push origin copilot/fix-50 --force-with-lease`
3. This will update PR #51 with all commits rebased onto the latest master

## Testing Recommendation

Before merging PR #51, it's recommended to:
1. Verify the Hugo site builds successfully: `hugo`
2. Test the site locally: `hugo server`
3. Check that all pages render correctly
4. Verify the GitHub Actions workflow succeeds on the PR
