### NASA Swarmathon

NASA Swarmathon involves university and community college students to participate in virtual and/or physical robotics competition.
Through this program, students are expected to learn ROS (Robotic Operating System), develop an autonomous foraging algorithm, and
assemble a Swarmie (rover). By doing so, they not only learn about new robotic technology but also have the opportunity to add to
future NASA space exploration research. The inspiration came from the biological behaviors that ants exhibit during the foraging process.
It is a key component that has inspired the iAnt development team to create a search algorithm that models ant foraging behavior. Dr. Melanie Moses and her students at the University of New Mexico implemented search algorithms into the iAnt robots. The research
resulted in a partnership with NASA to further advance the search algorithms to be used for space expeditions to Mars.â€‹

  ACTIVITIES
  My DREU experience was really well-rounded. I get to experience nature during my time at the University of New Mexico.
  I played soccer every weekend almost. I want on hiking and white water rafting.
