Hello! Welcome to my new Quarto-powered blog. This represents a transition from Jekyll to Quarto for my blogging needs.

## Why Quarto?

Quarto offers several advantages for technical blogging:

- **Native support for multiple languages**: Python, R, Julia, and Observable
- **Executable code blocks**: Run code directly in your posts
- **Beautiful mathematical typesetting**: LaTeX equations render perfectly
- **Modern publishing workflow**: Easy to maintain and extend

## Features

This blog supports:

- Syntax highlighting
- Mathematical equations: $E = mc^2$
- Code execution
- Interactive plots
- And much more!

## Code Example

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a simple plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
