# Deployment Fix Documentation

## Problem

After merging the Hugo migration PR, the GitHub Pages site was serving README.md as the main page instead of the Hugo-generated website.

## Root Cause

The original workflow used `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` which deploys content to the `gh-pages` branch. However, for `username.github.io` repositories (user sites), GitHub Pages configuration needs to be properly set to serve from the correct source.

The issue occurred because:
1. The workflow was deploying to the `gh-pages` branch
2. GitHub Pages might have been configured to serve from the `master` branch root instead
3. When serving from master root, GitHub Pages would render README.md as the main page

## Solution

Updated the deployment workflow to use GitHub's official Pages deployment actions:
- `actions/configure-pages@v5` - Configures GitHub Pages settings
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` - Uploads the built site as an artifact
- `actions/deploy-pages@v4` - Deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages

### Key Changes

1. **Modern Deployment Method**: Uses GitHub's native Pages deployment instead of pushing to gh-pages branch
2. **Proper Permissions**: Added required permissions (`pages: write`, `id-token: write`)
3. **Concurrency Control**: Prevents multiple simultaneous deployments
4. **Environment Configuration**: Properly sets up the GitHub Pages environment

### Workflow Changes

- Split deployment into two jobs: `build` and `deploy`
- Build job creates the Hugo site and uploads it as an artifact
- Deploy job uses the artifact and deploys to GitHub Pages
- Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering
- Updated to use Hugo 0.134.3 explicitly

## Required GitHub Pages Configuration

For this fix to work, the GitHub Pages settings must be configured correctly:

1. Go to **Repository Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to: **GitHub Actions**

This allows the workflow to deploy directly without relying on branch-based deployment.

## Benefits

1. **No gh-pages Branch Needed**: Direct deployment to Pages without intermediate branch
2. **Proper Base URL**: Automatically uses the correct base URL from Pages configuration
3. **Better Control**: Explicit environment and concurrency management
4. **Modern Approach**: Uses GitHub's recommended deployment method

## Testing

After merging this fix:
1. The workflow will run automatically on push to master/main
2. Check the Actions tab to verify the workflow completes successfully
3. The site should be available at https://kirubeltadesse.github.io/
4. Verify that the Hugo-generated site is served, not README.md
