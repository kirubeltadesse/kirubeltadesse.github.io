Through out my undergraduate, I was actively involved in [robotics work](https://youtu.be/7-twuA5gL-4?si=s-ba2eCZYmQTDOoK). Which naturally lead me to start working with machine learning projects in graduate school.

Currently, I am actively learning different deep learning techniques. Which I will here soon!
