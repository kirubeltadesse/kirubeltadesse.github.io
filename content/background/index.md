Growing up in Ethiopia, I witnessed both the richness of history and the challenges of socio-economic problems. Early on, I believed politics was the only way to make meaningful change. A professor encouraged me to consider another path—that technology could also drive transformation. That advice reshaped my life.

I pursued Computer Engineering and discovered my passion for programming—the ability to translate human reasoning into algorithms and bring machines to life. From undergraduate research in robotics to graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence at Purdue University, I have been driven by the belief that science and engineering can provide practical solutions to society’s challenges.

Today, I work as a **Software Engineer at Bloomberg**, focusing on **distributed systems and enterprise infrastructure** for the Bloomberg Query Language (BQL). My work includes building enterprise **Java services** for BQL Permissioning and Metering, developing high-throughput **Kafka publishers and Flink consumers**, and contributing to workflow optimizations. I’ve also worked on internal projects that involved **enhancing legacy C++ code** and **Dockerizing services** to improve development efficiency. This experience has strengthened my expertise in **Java backend systems, stream processing, and large-scale workflow optimization**.

Earlier in my career, I contributed to **NASA’s Swarmathon research**, where I designed and tested swarm robotics algorithms in C++ using both physical robots and simulation environments. That project deepened my foundation in agile development, algorithm design, and applied robotics.

Across my career, I’ve combined engineering, design, and problem-solving skills with strong teamwork and leadership. While my professional work at Bloomberg focuses on distributed systems and infrastructure in Java and C++, my academic background and personal projects continue to explore the potential of **AI and robotics** as transformative technologies.
